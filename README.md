### The challenge (Situation)

### Expected Behaviour (Tasks)

- Creating an invoice
  - When creating a new invoice, an tag needs to be created. Each tag should be 2 random uppercased letters followed by 4 random numbers.
  - Invoices can be created either as drafts or as pending. Clicking "Save as Draft" should allow the user to leave any form field blank, but should create an ID if one doesn't exist and set the status to "draft". Clicking "Save & Send" should require all forms fields to be filled in, and should set the status to "pending".
  - Changing the Payments Terms field should set the `paymentDue` property based on the `issueDate` date plus the numbers of days set for the payment terms.
  - The `total` should be the sum of all items on the invoice.
- Editing an invoice
  - When saving changes to an invoice, all fields are required when the "Save Changes" button is clicked. If the user clicks "Cancel", any unsaved changes should be reset.
  - If the invoice being edited is a "draft", the status needs to be updated to "pending" when the "Save Changes" button is clicked. All fields are required at this stage.
- Users should be able to mark invoices as paid by clicking the "Mark as Paid" button. This should change the invoice's status to "paid".
- Users should receive a confirmation modal when trying to delete invoices.
- Add custom styling for the date and dropdown form fields.

### What I learned

- The proper way to work with state removing the need for boilerplate code and protecting it from future accidental modifications

- How to create event driven reducers to keep application logic out of the ui and instead in the reducer

```ts
// The Pattern
const reducer = (data) => (state, action) => {
  // âœ… you'll always have access to the latest server state in here
};

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery(key, queryFn);
  const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer(data));
}

// My Version
function authReducer(user?: Partial<IUser>, token?: string) {
  return produce((draft: IState, action: IAction) => {
    switch (action) {
      case 'auth/addUser':
        draft.user = user;
        break;
      case 'auth/addToken':
        draft.token = token;
        break;
      case 'auth/logout':
        draft.token = undefined;
        draft.user = undefined;
        break;
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unhandled action type: ${action}`);
    }
  });
}

function useAuth(client: GraphQLClient) {
  const refreshAuthQuery = useRefreshAuthQuery(client);
  const userQuery = useGetUserQuery(client);

  const token = refreshAuthQuery?.data?.refreshAuth?.token;
  if (token) client.setHeader('authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);

  const user = userQuery?.data?.user;

  const reducer = authReducer(user, token);
  return useReducer(reducer, initialState);
}
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Javascript:The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/9781491952016/) - This book by author David Flanagan helped me improve in my Javascript knowledge. I really liked this book and it will be my companion guide going forward cus' there are still some important concepts I have to master.

- [React TypeScript Tutorial: Polymorphic Components](https://youtu.be/uZ8GZm5KEXY?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwi1AXijGTKM0BKtHzVC-LSK) - This amazing video resource helped me finally understand how the reusable components in the existing component libraries are created. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants is not familiar with this concept.

- [Get a catch block error message with TypeScript](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/get-a-catch-block-error-message-with-typescript) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand how to provide handle errors obtained in the catch block and make them type-safe. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Kent C. Dodds' Blog](hhttps://kentcdodds.com/blog) An awesome resource for major concepts in React, Typescript and so on. He also has a course [Epic React](https://epicreact.dev/) which expanded my React knowledge. I recommend it to everyone who wants to upgrade their thinking in React. Thanks Kent, you're the best ðŸŽ‰
- [Tk Dodo's Blog](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/all) A verry useful resource for major concepts in React, React Query etc. The blog exposed me to the hidden features of things I'd been using in React, and I was able to get up to speed with React Query using the blog and docs. Thanks TK, you're awesome ðŸŽ‰
